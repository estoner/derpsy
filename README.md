Derpsy
======

*tl; dr* here be dragons

This is a crude but functional little CI system that I hacked together a while back because I continually ran into problems 
getting Jenkins to deal well with pull requests.  We don't run it anymore, because [Travis](https://travis-ci.org)
is better, and I don't recommend using this yourself; I'm just leaving it up here in case I ever need to refer back
to it.

*To start:*
bundle exec ruby lib/derpsyd.rb start
